# Rlox

An interpreter for the **Lox Programming Language**: originally created by Robert Nystrom for the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) and implemented in Rust by yours truly.
This implementation only uses the Rust Standard Library. To hop into the interpreter, `git clone` the repo and `cargo run` to start a REPL session or `cargo run -- <path_to_lox_file>` to run the interpreter on a `.lox` file.
